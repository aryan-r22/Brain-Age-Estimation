## Analysing the codes  
The ideal set of parameters can be found using `Grid_Searcher.m` (wherever applicable), and the final results can be inferenced from `Main_Code.m`.  

## Acknowledgements

The codes have been written in MATLAB&reg;. We would like to express our gratitude to the respective authors for using their works.
